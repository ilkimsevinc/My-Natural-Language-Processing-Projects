# My Natural Language Processing Projects
Projects done in NLP course
Homework 1: 
Suppose that your code finds any possible match for the following patterns. You can assume that your code searches the patterns inside a variable named mytext which includes a short text. So design the shortest regular expression for each part and run your code on a sample text to make sure it works correctly. I will test your code with my own text. 
a) find all words which include successive non-numeric and non-alphabetic characters with the length of 3n (n >=1), while both sides of this substring (with a length of 3n) are surrounded by any number (greater thanor equal to 1) of alphabetic characters. 
part b)    all words (including only alphabetic or numeric characters) the length of which, is an even number.

Homework 2:
In this homework, your code gets a string and an integer number as input from the user and finds and prints all strings inside this text file: D:\input.txt. Note that the text inside D:\input.txt should be first loaded to a variable and then should be tokenized. Then you can use the edit distance method of NLTK to find those strings. For example, if the input string is "look", the integer is 1, and the input.txt includes the following text, the output of your homework should be as below:

The output of your code:
took
hook
loop
-------------------
input.txt:

This is a sample loop including some words such as look hook and took   

Homework 3: 
In this homework, you are expected to apply three classifiers to three different labelled datasets and report the performance metrics, namely, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure.

1) Download three datasets from UCI machine learning repository website or any other webpage.

2) Then, transform the dataset to a Weka file, and feed it to Weka.

3) Add the value of the metrics mentioned above to a PDF file. 

4) Find the most efficient features for each dataset and report their names in the PDF file as well.
